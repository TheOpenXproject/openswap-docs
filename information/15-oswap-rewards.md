# 15% OpenSwap rewards

**OpenSwap 15% Validator Node**

When you delegate ONE tokens to this Harmony One validator pool, you'll earn 15% of your rewards in the form of OpenX Tokens.  Out of the 20% fee, 15% is sent back to you and 5% is kept as a constant fee.  [Click here to be directed to the Harmony One staking site and the 15% OpenSwap Validator](https://staking.harmony.one/validators/mainnet/one1p2e0a0806jv8tqr37k7c8k67zgfjwtzpf9apv2).

**This validator node helps create automatic and constant buying pressure for the OpenSwap token.** &#x20;

How does this work?\
As long as the validator is elected, when ONE rewards are awarded, 15% of the rewards issued will be swapped for OpenX tokens at market price.  The token swap occurs every 10 minutes; these tokens will then be sent to the corresponding wallet of the delegator.  The remaining ONE token rewards will be stored on the harmony one staking platform; where they can be claimed at any time.
