# Optimism relaunch

Due to the harmony horizon hack, and their inability to restore the pegg, we had no other choice but to move forward and relaunch our project on Optimism.

You can find us at https://openxswap.exchange\


Harmony OpenX holders will be refunded the value of their tokens once our market cap on Optimism allows it. but until then you are asked to please remove liquidity and to wait until we've set up the migration process which hopefully wont take too much time.\
