# Liquidity

In DeFi, a liquidity pool is a pairing of two tokens, locked into a smart contract, that provides liquidity for those tokens on the OpenSwap exchange.

Liquidity providers are able to select tokens and add corresponding liquidity to that pool. If a pool does not exist, you will be prompted to create one, where you will be asked to fix the initial price.
