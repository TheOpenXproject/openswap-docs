# ONE token (Single Stake)

You can single stake Harmony ONE tokens with the OpenSwap Validator on the Harmony ONE staking site. &#x20;

By staking with the OpenSwap validator, you will be contributing to constant buying pressure for the OpenX token.  As long as the validator is elected, when ONE rewards are awarded, a percentage of the rewards issued will be swapped for OpenX tokens at market price.  These tokens will then be sent to the corresponding wallet of the delegator.  The remaining ONE tokens will be stored on the harmony one staking platform; where they can be claimed at any time.
